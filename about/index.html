<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
  Right now, I'm a college student. After dropping out of college in 2014, I've returned to finish
  my bachelor's degree. You can read more about why I did that in
  <a href="/blog/college">Why I went back to college.</a>
</p>

<p>
  I have a few interests that I try to post about here, including
  <a href="/blog/hiking-texas">hiking</a>, cooking, and reading.
