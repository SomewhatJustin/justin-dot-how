    <h1>How Linux has Changed My Life, so far</h1>
    
      <p>I find myself once again thinking about Linux. I never thought this would happen to me.</p>
<h2>The Push Away from Apple</h2>
<p>I was a Mac guy from ~2011-2024. And not just a casual user - I was the type of guy to give presentations at work about how you could use your Mac more effectively. I knew all the good software, I produced videos on a now unlisted YouTube channel about my favorite tips, tricks, and software, and used it daily. I found that the Mac was an excellent development platform. I was comfortable on the platform, and it worked seamlessly with my other Apple devices.</p>
<p>I came to Linux very slowly, then all at once.</p>
<p>I became a fan of Apple around 2010 when Steve Jobs really started to enter my consciousness. I remeber seeing a few of his keynotes live and I thought he was extraordinary, and by extension, so was the company he helped build. Even after his death in 2011, I remained a fan of the company, but my attitude slowly changed from fan to casual observer, then to neutral customer. I liked that I didn't have to worry about Apple &quot;selling my data&quot;. Their business model was to make great hardware and convince me to buy it. They were very good at that because they make excellent hardware!</p>
<p>What really soured me on Apple was their treatment of developers. Even though I am not an Apple developer myself, I do consider myself a supporter of small business. Apple's 30% cut of nearly all economic activity that occurs on their platform eventually became inexcusable.</p>
<p>I was fine with the iPhone being locked down (even though I was very much a jailbreaker), I don't like the direction that Apple is taking on the Mac platform. It has slowly become more locked down and more naggy.</p>
<p>On their own, these reasons weren't enough to make me switch. They were annoyances, sure, but with Apple's excellent hardware, nearly bug-free OS, and selection of botique apps, I was still willing to stay.</p>
<h2>The Pull Towards Linux</h2>
<p>As I transitioned from Product Manager to Software Engineer, my interest in operating systems returned. I always knew that Linux was out there as an option, but it was really only for the die-hard crazy zealots, of course. macOS was the sane option, Windows was the Excel-head option, and Linux was for the freaks.</p>
<p>As someone who was now much more invested in learning how computers work under the hood, I slowly came around to the idea of Linux.</p>
<p>I had installed Ubuntu on one of my machines as a small child only to find that my WiFi card didn't work out of the box. With my only accessible devices being unable to connect to the internet, I bailed and re-installed Windows.</p>
