    <h1>My Linux Journey After 12 Years of macOS</h1>
    
      <p>Over the last few months, I've become obsessed with Linux. After 12 years as a full-time macOS user, I've switched entirely.</p>
<p>In the same way that some people like to tinker with their car as a hobby, I've found joy in tinkering with Linux machines. Getting things to work is a delight, even if it takes more effort. In fact, it's the effort itself that makes it so gratifying.</p>
<p>In the Apple ecosystem, it's easy to take for granted the &quot;it just works&quot; factor. But it’s so real. While Linux has improved vastly in this regard, I don't see it catching up to Apple anytime soon.</p>
<p>That said, Linux is freeing and fun. Do you know how many permission dialogs I've been bombarded with? Exactly zero.</p>
<p>I started my journey with a $200 ThinkPad I found on Facebook Marketplace. It’s a fantastic way to experiment with different distros. Switching can be challenging, but it's not impossible. Along the way, I've learned so much.</p>
