    <h1>Hiking in Austin and Central Texas</h1>
    
      <p>As someone who likes to hike, I'm often asked where my favorite spots are. Assuming you're starting from Austin, here are my favorite spots organized by how far you need to drive:</p>
<h2>0 to 10 Miles</h2>
<h3>Walnut Creek</h3>
<p>I hope you like dogs! Walnut Creek is a smaller park, but it's densely packed with trees so you quickly feel immersed in nature. Plus, the titular creek is a fun place to go to cool down in the summer.</p>
<h3>McKinney Falls</h3>
<p>Bonus points for being a Texas State Park. If you don't mind a bit of a crowd and the proximity to the airport, this is a nice place to go.</p>
<h2>11-30 Miles</h2>
<h3>McKinney Roughs</h3>
<p>Not be confused with McKinney Falls! If you find yourself missing pine trees, this is the spot to be. It's owned by LCRA, so the entrance fee is about $10/person, but you do get some nice amenities and nicely maintained trails as a result.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a State Park equivalent, I would recommend...</p>
<h3>Bastrop State Park</h3>
<p>Worth the drive if you enjoy seclusion. You'll see some pines here, cross a creek, and the property itself is fairly large so there's plenty of space to spread out.</p>
<h2>31-100 Miles</h2>
<h3>Colorado Bend State Park</h3>
<p>If I get a day to myself, this is likely where I'll end up. Colorado Bend is nearly a two hour drive from Austin, but it's well worth the visit.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite trails:</strong> Cedar Chopper Loop → Dogleg Canyon. Dogleg Canyon is a tiny canyon that you can climb around in.

The park is also rated a 3 on the <a href="http://www.bigskyastroclub.org/lp_bortle.html">Bortle Scale</a>, meaning you'll get a chance to see the Milky Way.
