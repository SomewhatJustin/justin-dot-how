title: My Linux Journey After 12 Years of macOS
---

Over the last few months, I've become obsessed with Linux. After 12 years as a full-time macOS user, I've switched entirely.

In the same way that some people like to tinker with their car as a hobby, I've found joy in tinkering with Linux machines. Getting things to work is a delight, even if it takes more effort. In fact, it's the effort itself that makes it so gratifying.

In the Apple ecosystem, it's easy to take for granted the "it just works" factor. But it’s so real. While Linux has improved vastly in this regard, I don't see it catching up to Apple anytime soon.

That said, Linux is freeing and fun. Do you know how many permission dialogs I've been bombarded with? Exactly zero.

I started my journey with a $200 ThinkPad I found on Facebook Marketplace. It’s a fantastic way to experiment with different distros. Switching can be challenging, but it's not impossible. Along the way, I've learned so much.
